 was written by Napoleon Hill in 1937 and promoted as a personal development and self-improvement book.
 He claimed to be inspired by a suggestion from business magnate and later-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.
 Think and Grow Rich is based on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success, said to be the result of more than 
 twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes.
Hill studied their habits and drew some 16 "laws" to be applied to achieve success. Think and Grow Rich
 condenses them, providing the reader with 14 principles in the form of a "Philosophy of Achievement".
  The book asserts that desire, faith, and persistence can propel one to great heights if one can suppress
   negative thoughts and focus on long-term goals.

 is a non-fiction book by American author Robert Greene. The book is a bestseller, selling over 1.2 million copies in the United States, and is popular with prison inmates and celebrities.
The 48 Laws of Power is popular with well-known rappers, entrepreneurs, celebrities, athletes and actors including 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Busta Rhymes, Ludacris, DJ Premier, Drake, Dov Charney, Brian Grazer, Andrew Bynum, Chris Bosh, Michael Jackson, Courtney Love and Will Smith.
Greene initially formulated some of the ideas in The 48 Laws of Power while working as a writer in Hollywood and concluding that today's power elite shared similar traits with powerful figures throughout history. In 1995, Greene worked as a writer at Fabrica, an art and media school, and met a book packager named Joost Elffers. Greene pitched a book about power to Elffers and six months later, Elffers requested that Greene write a treatment.
Although Greene was unhappy in his current job, he was comfortable and saw the time needed to write a proper book proposal as too risky. However, at the time Greene was rereading his favorite biography about Julius Caesar and took inspiration from Caesar's decision to cross the Rubicon River and fight Pompey, thus inciting the Great Roman Civil War. Greene wrote the treatment, which later became The 48 Laws of Power. He would note this as the turning point of his life.
